# Secure Software Development for Safety-Critical Cyber-Physical Systems

This repository contains the bachelor thesis project developed as part of the
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Patras.

## Overview
The thesis investigates the application of formal verification techniques to
safety-critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) using the F★ programming language.
The goal is to ensure correctness, safety, and liveness properties in systems
where failures may lead to critical consequences.

## Case Studies
- **Insulin Dose Decision System**  
  A simplified safety-critical decision system modeling strict safety constraints
  for medical dosing logic.

- **Smart Irrigation Control System**  
  A sensor-driven control system modeling responsiveness and safety in
  automated irrigation.

## Technologies & Concepts
- F★ programming language
- Formal verification
- Refinement types and invariants
- Safety and liveness properties
- Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)

## Relevance to Industry
The concepts demonstrated in this work are directly applicable to
safety-critical industrial domains such as process control, automation,
and decision-support systems.
